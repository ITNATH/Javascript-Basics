        Varables in Javascript

These are the syntax used to represent a variable 'var const let'

in most programing language variables are ended with a corma sign ;

variable are likes diff boxes with ID(for specified identication) in an office Rack
Variable is the Main storage for data.



 'let var const'  are used to create variable(storage platform) which would enable us declare our "excutable operation"
 eg 
 
    let firstname ="tola " (inline)

          or 

    let firstname;        declared variable to accept data(multi- line)
     
    firstname= "tola";    stored data assigned

    There are two ways of writing variable
    inline
          and

    multi-line

// document.write(message)

// we can also declare and assign variables//

//typeof show the type of data//

let surname= "Nath is a developer"
let count= 9
let arr= ["2"]
let nath= true
document.write(typeof nath)

          // data types//
